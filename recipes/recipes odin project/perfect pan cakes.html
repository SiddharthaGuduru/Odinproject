        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white vinegar spice</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, 
                    for greasing, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>toppings of choice, e.g. maple syrup or fruit, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <li>Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                </li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <li>Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.</li>
     
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <li>Whisk together flour, sug
                 ar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.</li>
                 <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.
                </li>
                 <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <li>Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; don't overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.</li>
                 <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <li>Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.</li>
            </ul>
